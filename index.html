	<!--in my previous version, i utilised bootstrap to try and make my page more dynamic.
	however, i felt that it was very messy and the template underutilised jquery and js a lot.
	making the pages unnecessarily long. in this iteration i will be using jquery to add my navbars and
	footers. This enables each page to contain only the information needed for readers, which makes
	it easier to design the page as well, since i do not need to change each page individually
	when links change. -->
